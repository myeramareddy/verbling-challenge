### Requirements

Create a simple scrollable/searchable list where list items can be expanded and collapsed.

- Item area should be scrollable with a fixed width of 400px and a height of 400px.
- UI Should include an "Add" button that prompts user for input (can use `window.prompt`) and adds a new list item to the top of the list.
- List items should have a height of 50px when closed, and a variable height that fits to item content when expanded.
- When a list item is closed, the contained text should be truncated with an ellipsis. (ex: Truncat...)
- The search bar should suggest a filtered subset of the available list items that have text that matches the search string in either the title or the item body.
- List items should be clickable, toggling a list item's expanded/collapsed state.
- UI should include an "Expand all" button should expand all list items
- UI should include a "Collapse all" button should collapse all list items
- UI should include a "Toggle all" button should toggle the expanded/collapsed state of all items.
- Data and View layers should be organized and efficiently structured to meet the needs of the app
